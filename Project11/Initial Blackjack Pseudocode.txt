-Deal both user and computer a starting hand of 2 random card values,  alternating per card(Computer second card is unknown to user).

-Calculate the user's score based on their card values.

-Ask the user if they want to get another card.

-Once the user is done and no longer wants to draw any more cards, let the computer play. The computer should keep drawing cards until it beats the user, gets 21, or goes over 21.

-Reveal computer's second card to the user.

-Compare user and computer scores and see if it's a win, loss, or draw.	

-Game ends immediately when user score goes over 21 or if the user or computer gets a blackjack.

-Detect when computer or user has a blackjack (Ace is 1 or 11).

-If computer gets blackjack on first 2 cards, then the user loses (even if the user also has a blackjack). If the user gets a blackjack, then they win (unless the computer also has a blackjack - its a draw).

-If an ace is drawn, count it as 11. But if the total goes over 21, count the ace as 1 instead.

-Print out the player's and computer's final hand and their scores at the end of the game.
	
-After the game ends, ask the user if they'd like to play again. Clear the console for a fresh start.
