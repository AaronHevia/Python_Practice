# Python Practice
Practice projects using Python.

## Project 1:  Band Name Generator
A simple console project to practice variable naming and string concatenation.  This project creates a band name based on the city the user is born and a pet name.

## Project 2:  Tip Calculator
A console based project which will calculate how much to tip and determine how much each person will pay when splitting the bill.  This is a practice of proper use of primitive data types, basic mathematical operations in python, number manipulation, and using f strings in python.
