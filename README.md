# Python Practice
100 Days of Python practice projects with Dr. Angela Yu.  Code is written as how I perceived goals at the time of the project.  Will return to them once in a while to incorporate additional features, tests, and refactoring.

## Project 1:  Band Name Generator
A simple console project to practice variable naming and string concatenation.  This project creates a band name based on the city the user is born and a pet name.  **Input Validation not yet implemented.**

## Project 2:  Tip Calculator
A console based project which will calculate how much to tip and determine how much each person will pay when splitting the bill.  This is a practice of proper use of primitive data types, basic mathematical operations in python, number manipulation, and using f strings in python.  **Input Validation not yet implemented.**

## Project 3:  Treasure Island
A console project with the practice of conditional statements, logical operators, code blocks and scope.  The project is a base of a "choose your own adventure" game where the user makes decisions based on questions and scenarios prompted.  **Input Validation not yet implemented.**

## Project 4:  Rock, Paper, Scissors
Here you will play against the computer the game of rock, paper, scissors done in console.  This project uses the simple practice of randomisation, choice conversion to an index, and use of a list.  **Input Validation not yet implemented.**

## Project 5:  Password Generator
A basic password generator which will create a random password based on the number of characters required.  This project is written as a console app and practices the use of loops, range, code blocks, and randomisation.  **Input Validation not yet implemented.**

## Project 6:  Maze Escape Challenge
This project practices the use of functions and while loops to help Reeborg complete the maze from any starting point.  Movement functions were predefined in the reeborg program.  Code was tested under the three problem world layouts where Reeborg is placed at a specific problem point facing different directions (problem worlds can be loaded in Additional Options tab).  Maze builder can be found at:  https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json.

## Project 7:  Hangman Project
Creating a base project of the hangman game in console.  **Future edition can incorporate API to get words from dictionaries vice creating a list of words.  Input Validation not fully implemented.**

## Project 8:  Caesar Cipher
Console based app which practices use of functions with inputs, arguments, and parameters to create the encryption/decryption algorithm of the caesar cipher.  **Input Validation not fully implemented.**

## Project 9:  Blind Auction Program
This project practices the use of programming dictionaries and nesting to create a silent auction program to keep users from knowing what the competition has bid.  **Input Validation not yet implemented.**

## Project 10:  Calculator
This project practices the use of functions with outputs.  This is a simple text-based calculator which will calculate the simple functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide).  **Future editions may incorporate additional calculator functionality to further extend proof of concept.  Input Validation not fully implemented.**

## Project 11:  Blackjack
Console application of blackjack.  The computer is the dealer.  Currently, set up with infinite deck.  **Future editions will incorporate multiplayer, deck builder and shuffle like in the casinos, and additional blackjack strategy rules (use of currency, split rule, etc.)**

## Project 12:  Number Guessing Game
Console game which lets the user guess a number within a certain number of guesses.  **Input Validation not yet implemented.**

## Project 13:  Higher or Lower Game
Game which lets the user guess which person has more followers than another then continue until they have guessed wrong.  **Input Validation not yet implemented.  Future iterations may attempt to connect to an API to feed people and follower numbers.**

## Project 14:  Coffee Vending Machine
Program which represents a coffee vending machine.  Price will fluctuate depending on ingredients and type of coffee.  **Input Validation not fully implemented.  Future editions to account for money in machine to provide the proper amount of depending on coins in machine.**
