# Python Practice
Practice projects using Python.

## Project 1:  Band Name Generator
A simple console project to practice variable naming and string concatenation.  This project creates a band name based on the city the user is born and a pet name.  **Input Validation not yet implemented.**

## Project 2:  Tip Calculator
A console based project which will calculate how much to tip and determine how much each person will pay when splitting the bill.  This is a practice of proper use of primitive data types, basic mathematical operations in python, number manipulation, and using f strings in python.  **Input Validation not yet implemented.**

## Project 3:  Treasure Island
A console project with the practice of conditional statements, logical operators, code blocks and scope.  The project is a base of a "choose your own adventure" game where the user makes decisions based on questions and scenarios prompted.  **Input Validation not yet implemented.**

## Project 4:  Rock, Paper, Scissors
Here you will play against the computer the game of rock, paper, scissors done in console.  This project uses the simple practice of randomisation, choice conversion to an index, and use of a list.  **Input Validation not yet implemented.**

## Project 5:  Caesar Cipher
A basic "tool to decrypt/encrypt with Caesar. Caesar cipher (or Caesar code) is a shift cipher, one of the most easy and most famous encryption systems".  This project is written as a console app and practices the use of for loops, range and code blocks.  **Input Validation not yet implemented.**
